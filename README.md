# History

It's 28 March 2015 and let's see what I remember…

- I was running [MythTV](https://www.mythtv.org/) on MythBuntu as a PVR.
- I had a twitter bot account that could tweet what was going to be recorded. This was very useful to check the server uptime while on holidays!
- I want to be able to send tweets to the bot, telling it what to record. I think I had the bot reading those tweets, but don't believe it ever actually did schedule recordings.
- My MythTV box died and I never replaced it…

Here's the code, saved from code.google.com before it closed down.
